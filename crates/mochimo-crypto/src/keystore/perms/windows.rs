//! The Windows permission model: the second arm of [`super`], and one of the
//! two files under `src/` that hold `unsafe` -- the binary's console is the
//! other.
//!
//! # The same two standards, in access-control lists
//!
//! The Unix arm makes one thing and accepts another: it creates at `0700` and
//! `0600`, and it refuses a directory another local user can write to. This
//! arm keeps both standards and changes only what they are written in.
//!
//! | Unix arm | this arm |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | directory created `0700` | directory created with a protected access list granting this user full control and nobody else anything, inherited by what is created inside it |
//! | file created `0600` | file created with a protected access list granting this user full control and nobody else anything |
//! | refuse group- or other-write | refuse an access list that lets anyone but this user, `SYSTEM` or the Administrators group write, and refuse a directory owned by anyone else |
//!
//! **The descriptor is given to `CreateFileW` and `CreateDirectoryW`, not set
//! afterwards.** Access is checked when a handle is opened, so a file created
//! with an inherited access list and restricted a moment later can already be
//! open, for writing, in another user's process -- and that handle keeps its
//! rights after the list changes. The Unix arm passes the mode to `open` for
//! the same reason. `std`'s `OpenOptions` takes no security descriptor on
//! Windows, which is the whole reason this file calls `CreateFileW` itself.
//!
//! **Protected, so nothing is inherited.** A descriptor without the protected
//! flag merges the parent's inheritable entries into the one given, and a
//! parent can carry an entry that applies to children only -- `Authenticated
//! Users` with modify rights on everything created under `C:\` is the stock
//! example. The given list is then not the list the file has.
//!
//! # Which trustees are accepted, and why those three
//!
//! This user, because the store is theirs. `SYSTEM` and the Administrators
//! group, because they are what `root` is on the Unix arm: the mode check
//! never asks about `root` either, since no permission bit binds it, and on
//! Windows the Administrators group can take ownership of any object whatever
//! its list says. Refusing a directory because an administrator could write to
//! it would refuse every home directory on the platform and protect against
//! nobody who could not take the file anyway. `OWNER RIGHTS` (`S-1-3-4`) is
//! accepted because it names the owner, and the owner is checked on its own.
//!
//! The strings are Windows' well-known security identifiers in the form
//! `ConvertSidToStringSidW` prints them, compared as strings to the same
//! function's output for each entry. They are retyped rather than generated,
//! against the rule `consts` states for protocol constants, and the argument
//! is that they are not this protocol's constants: they are part of the
//! documented interface of every Windows since NT, and a SID that changed
//! would break every access list on the machine before it broke this check.
//!
//! **The owner is a writer.** An object's owner may rewrite its access list
//! whatever the list says, so a directory owned by another user is one that
//! user can open to themselves at will. It is refused as a grant of
//! `WRITE_DAC` to that user, which is the right an owner holds implicitly.
//!
//! # Which rights count as write
//!
//! The ones that change what the directory names or who may change it:
//! adding a file or a subdirectory, deleting a child, deleting or renaming
//! the directory itself, rewriting its list or its owner, and the two generic
//! rights that map onto those. **Write, and not read**, for the Unix arm's
//! reason: a co-user who can list the directory learns that a store exists,
//! which is metadata; a co-user who can delete a child can move the snapshot
//! out from under a live handle, which defeats the commit's atomicity
//! directly. `FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES` and `FILE_WRITE_EA` are left out: they
//! change the directory's own attributes and not what it names.
//!
//! Entries that apply only to children are skipped, because this module gives
//! every file it creates its own protected list and nothing inherits from the
//! directory. Denying entries are skipped too, which makes the check stricter
//! than the effective access it approximates: a grant followed by a denial of
//! the same right is refused here although Windows would not honour it. That
//! is the fail-closed direction, and computing effective access properly is
//! `AuthzAccessCheck` and a resource manager, for a case no default access
//! list produces. An entry of a type this check does not read is refused
//! rather than skipped, for the same reason.
//!
//! **No access list at all is a refusal.** A null DACL grants every right to
//! everyone, and it is what a volume with no access control reports -- FAT
//! and exFAT, the removable-media case. It is refused as a grant to Everyone.
//!
//! # Why the `unsafe` is here and not elsewhere
//!
//! None of this has a `std` interface: `std` neither reads a security
//! descriptor nor creates a file under one. Every call below is a plain Win32
//! function through `windows-sys`, and every `unsafe` block carries the
//! condition it relies on. The library's boundary is this file and nothing
//! else: `unsafe_is_confined_to_declared_files` names it, and Miri, which interprets
//! Rust and cannot interpret a foreign call, walks none of it -- nor could it,
//! since the Miri run is on a Unix host where this file is not compiled.
//!
//! # What has run, and what is not established
//!
//! **Run:** `./board check` passes on a GitHub Windows runner -- Windows
//! Server 2025, build 26100 -- where every store the tests open is checked by
//! this file, the keystore makes its lock through it, and the slot layout
//! makes and opens every store file through `create_slot` and `open_slot`.
//! The three `cfg(windows)` tests in `tests/keystore.rs` pass there:
//! `open_refuses_a_directory_everyone_can_write_to`,
//! `a_store_created_under_a_writable_parent_inherits_nothing_from_it`, and
//! `a_slot_held_open_without_write_sharing_refuses_the_open_by_name`, which
//! measures the refusal `open_slot` makes. `FORK.md` records the runs.
//!
//! **Not established:** the runner's account is an elevated administrator,
//! and a directory it creates is owned by the Administrators group, so the
//! owner check met that group and never the user's own SID, which is the owner
//! an unelevated desktop gives a directory. A null list, an entry type the
//! check refuses as unread, and a denying entry were not met at all. What this
//! file says of those rests on Microsoft's documentation and `std`'s source.
