//! The store's Windows layout: two slots, each rewritten in place, so that no
//! commit creates, renames or deletes a directory entry.
//!
//! On Windows the snapshot is not replaced by a rename. `accounts.mks` is
//! slot 0 and `accounts.mks.1` is slot 1; each holds one frame around one
//! whole image in [`super::format`]'s layout. A commit writes the slot that
//! does not hold the newest image and flushes it, and `open` reads both and
//! takes the image with the higher generation. `FORK.md`, at the item on the
//! directory flush, carries the argument: a crash at every step, torn writes
//! included, and what holds once a flush returns.
//!
//! # The frame
//!
//! ```text
//! magic[8] = "MCMKSLOT" | frame_version u16 = 1 | payload_len u32
//! | payload[payload_len]   version 1: one image, or nothing for the vacant frame
//! | check[32]              SHA3-256 over every byte before it
//! ```
//!
//! A slot file is one frame and nothing after it, so its length is
//! [`OVERHEAD`] plus its payload's, and a file of any other length is torn.
//!
//! **The envelope is fixed and only the payload is versioned.** The magic, the
//! version, the length and the check stand where they stand here in every
//! frame version, so a frame this build did not write is still one whose check
//! it can verify: an intact frame of a later version is refused, and only a
//! frame whose check fails is torn. A later version free to move the check
//! would have this build call its slot torn and take the older one beside it.
//!
//! **The check is keyless, on purpose.** The image's own tag refuses a torn
//! image too, but only once a key exists, and it cannot say whether an image
//! was torn or altered -- by design, as `Error::WrongPassword`'s doc argues.
//! The check sorts the slots first. A frame whose check fails is what a crash
//! leaves, and it is never a refusal while the other slot holds an image. A
//! frame whose check passes and whose tag then fails is sealed under another
//! key or altered, which no crash makes, and it is refused as `WrongPassword`,
//! as a damaged snapshot is.
//!
//! **No counter in the frame.** The image's `generation` orders the slots, and
//! it is in the ciphertext so that a file does not say how often it was
//! written; a plaintext counter would undo that, so both images are decrypted
//! and compared.
//!
//! # What `open` takes
//!
//! [`take`]'s rules, in order:
//!
//! * a frame in slot 0 with no slot 1 beside it is refused. Slot 1 is created
//!   before slot 0 is ever a frame, so only a deletion leaves that, and taking
//!   slot 0 would step back to an older image without a word;
//! * with no intact image in either frame, slot 0 is read exactly as a store in
//!   the rename layout is -- the whole file one image -- or, when slot 0 is a
//!   frame, the store is refused;
//! * otherwise every intact image is decrypted under one key, derived from an
//!   intact frame's header, and any that fails is refused. A slot 0 that is not
//!   a frame is taken too if it decrypts and parses, and otherwise it is the
//!   torn remainder of an overwrite -- this writer overwrites a plain image only
//!   once slot 1 holds a flushed frame -- and is passed over;
//! * of what is left the higher generation is the newest, and two at one
//!   generation are refused, since the writer never makes that pair.
//!
//! # Where this is compiled
//!
//! On Windows, where `Keystore::open_with` and the commit call it, and under
//! `cfg(test)` on every platform, so these rules are tested on every board
//! against images the format itself seals. The write path and the reads
//! through held handles are Windows code in `medium` and the keystore, and
//! only a Windows runner runs them.
